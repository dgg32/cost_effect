COVID_PCR_test	NULL	The COVID-19 PCR test is the most accurate and reliable test available for detecting and diagnosing SARS-CoV-2, which is why it is considered the “gold standard” for testing. Samples are collected from the respiratory system (nasal swab) to verify whether the infection is in fact present. The sample is taken using a swab, which resembles a long Q-Tip, to collect virus material found in your nose and may cause mild discomfort for 5 to 10 seconds. This viral test is recommended to diagnose both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.	NULL
