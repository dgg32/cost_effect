Paxlovid						Medicine		Paxlovid is an antiviral medicine that works by stopping the virus that causes coronavirus (COVID-19) from growing and spreading in the body. It's used to treat early COVID-19 infection and help to prevent more severe symptoms.
Remdesivir						Medicine		Remdesivir is a nucleotide prodrug of an adenosine analog. It binds to the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and inhibits viral replication by terminating RNA transcription prematurely. Remdesivir has demonstrated in vitro and in vivo activity against SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir retains in vitro neutralization activity against the Omicron variant and its subvariants.
COVID_PCR_test						Medical_test		The COVID-19 PCR test is the most accurate and reliable test available for detecting and diagnosing SARS-CoV-2, which is why it is considered the “gold standard” for testing. Samples are collected from the respiratory system (nasal swab) to verify whether the infection is in fact present. The sample is taken using a swab, which resembles a long Q-Tip, to collect virus material found in your nose and may cause mild discomfort for 5 to 10 seconds. This viral test is recommended to diagnose both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.
